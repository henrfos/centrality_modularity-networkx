# centrality_modularity-networkx
Playing with centrality based on degree/eigenvector centrality using networkx library

Measuringcentrality based on degree/eigenvector centrality using
networkx library. 

• Detecting modularity of the graph using label propagation or
louvain method (use networkx libraries). 

• Modifying the size and color based on the above measures. 

• spring layout or fruchterman_reingold layout for visualizing
the graph.
